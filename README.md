# dotfiles Anderson Cust√≥dio

## Project Archived

For a long time I have kept some of the settings I use in my daily life in this repository,
the main idea was to share knowledge about settings in the vim editor.

The truth is that it's been a while since these settings have been outdated, I made another
one completely in Lua and it would be laborious to separate a good part of the code that I 
can't share and put it in this repository, and I also believe that it's not worth it for me
to do something completely modular that facilitates this sharing since nowadays there are 
numerous projects with this proposal.

I will be sharing a bit of what I know on my blog https://andersoncustodio.com for those who
are interested.
